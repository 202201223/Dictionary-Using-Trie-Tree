# Dictionary Using Trie Tree

This project implements a **Dictionary** using a **Trie Tree** data structure. The Trie (prefix tree) is an efficient data structure used for dynamic, fast retrieval of strings, making it ideal for dictionary applications where search and autocomplete features are essential.

### Key Features:
- **Trie Tree Structure**: Provides efficient storage and retrieval of words. Each node represents a character, enabling fast search operations.
- **Insert Words**: Add new words to the dictionary, storing them in a hierarchical manner.
- **Search**: Find complete words or check if a prefix exists in the dictionary, supporting autocomplete functionality.
- **Delete Words**: Remove words from the Trie, efficiently adjusting the structure.
- **Autocomplete Suggestions**: Get word suggestions based on a given prefix, powered by the Trieâ€™s prefix-based storage.

### How It Works:
- **Inserting**: Words are stored character by character, with common prefixes sharing nodes in the Trie.
- **Searching**: Check if a word exists or find suggestions that match a given prefix.
- **Deletion**: Words can be removed from the Trie, ensuring that unused nodes are pruned efficiently.

### Future Enhancements:
- Implement spell-check functionality.
- Add support for storing word definitions and additional metadata.

This project showcases the practical application of the Trie Tree for fast search and autocomplete tasks, making it a powerful tool for dictionary management and word-based applications.
